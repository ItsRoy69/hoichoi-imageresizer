## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/hoichoi-opensource/imageresizer/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/hoichoi-opensource/imageresizer/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with your suggestion.
- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.
- Ensure it's not already in the issues list.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.

## Hacktoberfest-specific Guidelines

- Ensure your PRs are in line with the spirit of Hacktoberfest. No spammy PRs!
- Quality over quantity. It's better to have one meaningful PR than five PRs with minor text edits.
- If you're fixing a bug or adding a feature, discuss it in an issue first.

## Style Guides
